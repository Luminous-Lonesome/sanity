git add .
git commit -m "add sanity files"
git push origin main



Most commonly, this would be done by:

creating a "branch" off of the main branch
committing changes to local files
pushing that branch to remote
creating a "pull request" from the branch to main
merging those changes into the main branch remotely
updating your main branch locally


#create a new branch called update-readme
git checkout -b update-readme  

git status

git add .
git commit -m "update readme"


git push -u origin update-readme

git checkout main

git pull origin main
